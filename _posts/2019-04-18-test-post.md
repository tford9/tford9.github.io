## What to Expect

Welcome. If you've moved passed the main page then you may be interested in my blog or are deciding if you should be. In either case I'll give you a flavor of the type of content you can expect in my periodic posts. In order of predicted frequency, here are topics of what you might see.

1. Network Science (theory, learning, applications)
2. Algorithms
3. Useful software and packages

Although you're reading this post now (whenever this is), I expect this list to update as my interests change. To that end, I'll change the post date as necessary. I'd like this to be an interactive blog, so feel free to leave comments on posts or email me directly. 

Looking forward,

-Trenton
