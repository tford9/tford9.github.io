I'm **Trenton W. Ford** and am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in the Weninger Lab at the University of Notre Dame and an Editorial Fellow with The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. My area of research centers on misinformation, disinformation, and language, as they relate to online social media platforms. My work focuses on how social media users distribute misinformation and disinformation, along with how predictive systems can be built to detect some forms of misinformation and disinformation.

Most recently, my work on viewing memes through ecological lenses produced interesting insights about how memes compete and work together to modify the habitats(social media platforms) within which they exist.
