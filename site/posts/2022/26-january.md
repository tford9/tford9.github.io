Attempting to detect image manipulations, forgeries, and photoshops is a popular task for machine learning and an increasingly popular pastime for people. Image manipulations are often used for fun or aesthetics, but they also mislead and misinform their viewers. Detecting and pointing out manipulations allows viewers to decide an image’s intent. And while human intuition can go a long way towards detecting manipulations, these manipulations are designed to fool us. Various algorithms have been developed to help.
